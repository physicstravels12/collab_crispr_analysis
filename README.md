# CRISPR Analysis Package (R-canonical)

This repo is split into:

- `results_snapshot_current_data/`: frozen outputs from the current subset run.
- `pipeline_for_full_data/`: scripts/config/docs collaborators can run on full server data.

## Notes
- Canonical sceptre inference is R-based.
- Python `sceptre-python` and stale outputs were moved to `DONOTUSE` in the source workspace.
- Large raw matrices and caches are excluded from this repo.
